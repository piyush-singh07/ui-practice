            When we think of reading, most of us immediately think of stories, especially books. But there are many
            other types
            of reading materials that children can use to practice their developing reading skills. How many of these
            forms of
            print have you read with your children?

            Magazines. There are lots of great magazines for kids, both at the newsstand and available for digital
            downloads.

            Comics. Don't discount the power of comics to hook kids on reading. They are a great way to teach your
            children
            about the back and forth of dialog.

        Manuals. For kids who want to know how things work, manuals for things like cars, lawnmowers, and appliances can
        be
        great options -- and they build vocabulary, too.

        Newspapers. If you are worried about exposing your child to news articles about crime or traumatic events,
        choose a
        local community newspaper or give your child a specific section to read that you've already vetted.

        Poetry. Grab a collection of poems or sit down and write some with your children. Rhyming is an important skill
        for
        reading, and having your children write poems on their own is a great way to build that skill.

        Travel Brochures. They can plan fantasy vacations and learn a bit of geography, too.

        Encyclopedias. Did you read encyclopedias as a kid? Your child might have to read them online, but that's OK,
        too.
        Start with a subject and see where it takes the two of you.

        Sports Programs. Hold on to the programs that you are given at sporting events and let your kids read and reread
        about their favorite athletes and teams.

        Catalogs. Many catalogs now are so much more than just products and quick descriptions. Have your child make
        wish
        lists and fit in a little writing, too.

        Recipes. Cook with your kids and take turns reading the ingredients and instructions. This is a great example of
        real-life reading for kids of any age.

        Dictionaries. You might be hard pressed to convince your children to read a dictionary from cover to cover, but
        give
        them a challenge like: "Find a new word that starts with 'r'" or "Find a word with 13 letters" and they will end
        up
        doing a lot of reading with a plain old dictionary.

        Play Scripts. Explore what it might be like to be on screen or stage by reading a few scripts together. You can
        even
        put on a play after reading them.






































        

        Atlases. Atlases are packed with a wealth of reference information. Not only can your child map out a great
        adventure, but she can also read about land formations, population, and more.

        Road Signs. Kids start recognizing familiar signs at an early age. Keep that knowledge of environmental print
        going
        by playing sign games on road trips.

        Books They Write! Nothing is as powerful as reading their own writing. Encourage your child to write, and his
        reading will get a boost, too.
