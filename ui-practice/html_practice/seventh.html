    A document type definition (DTD) is a set of markup declarations that define a document type for an SGML-family
    markup language (GML, SGML, XML, HTML). <br>

   <blockquote> A DTD defines the valid building blocks of an XML document. It defines the document structure with a list of
    validated elements and attributes. A DTD can be declared inline inside an XML document, or as an external
    reference.[1]</blockquote>
    <br>

    XML uses a subset of SGML DTD.

    <br>

    <q> As of 2009, newer XML namespace-aware schema languages (such as W3C XML Schema and ISO RELAX NG) have largely
    superseded DTDs. A namespace-aware version of DTDs is being developed as Part 9 of ISO DSDL. DTDs persist in
    applications that need special publishing characters, such as the XML and HTML Character Entity References, which
    derive from larger sets defined as part of the ISO SGML standard effort. </q>
